# cubiomes

Cubiomes is a standalone library, written in C, that mimics the biome and feature generation of *Minecraft: Java Edition*.
It is intended as a powerful tool to devise very fast, custom seed-finding applications and large-scale map viewers with minimal memory usage.

## Relationship to upstream

This project is an active fork of [Cubiomes by Cubitect](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes). I will add features to it as I need them. Some of the features I have added, I have also opened PRs for. Others are outside the scope of Cubiomes as indicated by Cubitect. For example, he has said that things like chest loot are not within Cubiomes' scope. These features will just be maintained in this repository. You can see all my PRs [here](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes/issues?q=is%3Apr%20author%3Axpple).

Below is a list of all the major additions:

- Up-to-date biome generation.
- Ore generation (1.13+).
- Ore vein generation (1.18+).
- Stronghold generation (1.8+).
- Abandoned camp generation (26.3+).
- Structure loot support (1.13+). At the time of writing, the following structures are supported: Bastions (limited), Buried Treasures, Desert Pyramids, End Cities, Igloos, Jungle Temples, Nether Fortresses, Pillager Outposts, Ruined Portals (OW/NE), Shipwrecks, Strongholds and Abandoned Camps.
- Fast Xoroshiro128++ state advancement.
- Canyon/cave carvers (1.13+).
- Terrain generation (1.14+).
- Tectonic mod terrain (26.3): base surface height, climate and biomes, see [Tectonic Terrain](#tectonic-terrain).
- Various bug fixes.

MSVC is **not** supported for this fork. Please use MinGW, UCRT64, Clang, or GCC.

## Java bindings
I have set up the automatic creation of Java bindings based on commits to the master branch. See the [java-bindings](https://github.com/xpple/cubiomes/tree/java-bindings) branch for more information.

#### Cubiomes-Viewer

If you want to get started without coding, there is a [graphical application](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes-viewer) based on the upstream version of this library.


#### Audience

You should be familiar with the C programming language. A basic understanding of the Minecraft biome generation process would also be helpful.


## Getting Started

This section is meant to give you a quick starting point with small example programs if you want to use this library to find your own biome-dependent features.

All terminal commands seen below are for Unix/Linux systems; Windows is similar, barring some minor adjustments.

### Biome Generator

Let's create a simple program called `find_biome_at.c` which tests seeds for a Mushroom Fields biome at a predefined location.

```C
// check the biome at a block position
#include "generator.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // Set up a biome generator that reflects the biome generation of
    // Minecraft 1.18.
    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, MC_1_18, 0);

    // Seeds are internally represented as unsigned 64-bit integers.
    uint64_t seed;
    for (seed = 0; ; seed++)
    {
        // Apply the seed to the generator for the Overworld dimension.
        applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

        // To get the biome at a single block position, we can use getBiomeAt().
        int scale = 1; // scale=1: block coordinates, scale=4: biome coordinates
        int x = 0, y = 63, z = 0;
        int biomeID = getBiomeAt(&g, scale, x, y, z);
        if (biomeID == mushroom_fields)
        {
            printf("Seed %" PRId64 " has a Mushroom Fields biome at "
                "block position (%d, %d).\n", (int64_t) seed, x, z);
            break;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

You can compile this code by creating a shared library (`libcubiomes.so`, `libcubiomes.dylib` or `cubiomes.dll` depending on your OS) or an archive (`libcubiomes_static.a`) using the CMake build script:
```shell
$ cd cubiomes
$ cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ cmake --build build
```
Then you can compile your program, while linking the archive or shared library, using either of the following commands.
```shell
$ gcc find_biome_at.c -Lbuild -Wl,-rpath,build -lcubiomes -O3 -Wall -Wextra -fwrapv -lm # dynamic
$ gcc find_biome_at.c -Lbuild -lcubiomes_static -O3 -Wall -Wextra -fwrapv -lm # static
```
Both commands assume that your source code is saved as `find_biome_at.c` in the Cubiomes working directory. If your makefile is configured to use pthreads, you may also need to add the `-lpthread` option for the compiler.

The option `-fwrapv` enforces two's complement for signed integer overflow, which is otherwise undefined behavior. It is not really necessary for this example, but it is a common pitfall when dealing with code that emulates the behavior of Java.

If the archive fails to generate, or the compilation claims the library's functions are undefined or missing, run `cmake --build build --target clean` to delete the failed archive, then retry the process.

Running the program should output:
```shell
$ ./a.out
Seed 262 has a Mushroom Fields biome at block position (0, 0).
```

### Biome Generation in a Range

We can also generate biomes for an area or volume using `genBiomes()`. This will utilize whatever optimizations are available for the generator, which can be much faster than generating each position individually. (The layered generators for versions up to 1.17 will benefit significantly more from this than the noise-based ones.)

Before we can generate the biomes for an area or volume, we need to define the bounds with a `Range` structure and allocate the necessary buffer using `allocCache()`. The `Range` is described by a scale, position, and size, where each cell inside the `Range` represents an amount of `scale` blocks in the horizontal axes. The vertical direction is treated separately and always follows the biome coordinate scaling of 1:4, except for when `scale == 1`, in which case the vertical scaling is also 1:1.

The only supported values for `scale` are 1, 4, 16, 64, and (for the Overworld) 256. For versions up to 1.17, the scale is matched to an appropriate biome layer and will influence the biomes that can generate.

```C
// generate an image of the world
#include "generator.h"
#include "util.h"

int main()
{
    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, MC_1_18, LARGE_BIOMES);

    uint64_t seed = 123LL;
    applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

    Range r;
    // 1:16, a.k.a. horizontal chunk scaling
    r.scale = 16;
    // Define the position and size for a horizontal area:
    r.x = -60, r.z = -60;   // position (x,z)
    r.sx = 120, r.sz = 120; // size (width,height)
    // Set the vertical range as a plane near sea level at scale 1:4.
    r.y = 15, r.sy = 1;

    // Allocate the necessary cache for this range.
    int *biomeIds = allocCache(&g, r);

    // Generate the area inside biomeIds, indexed as:
    // biomeIds[i_y*r.sx*r.sz + i_z*r.sx + i_x]
    // where (i_x, i_y, i_z) is a position relative to the range cuboid.
    genBiomes(&g, biomeIds, r);

    // Map the biomes to an image buffer, with 4 pixels per biome cell.
    int pix4cell = 4;
    int imgWidth = pix4cell*r.sx, imgHeight = pix4cell*r.sz;
    unsigned char biomeColors[256][3];
    initBiomeColors(biomeColors);
    unsigned char *rgb = (unsigned char *) malloc(3*imgWidth*imgHeight);
    biomesToImage(rgb, biomeColors, biomeIds, r.sx, r.sz, pix4cell, 2);

    // Save the RGB buffer to a PPM image file.
    savePPM("map.ppm", rgb, imgWidth, imgHeight);

    // Clean up.
    free(biomeIds);
    free(rgb);

    return 0;
}
```


### Structure Generation

The generation of structures can usually be regarded as a two-stage process: generation attempts and biome checks. For most structures, Minecraft divides the world into a grid of regions (usually 32x32 chunks) and performs one generation attempt in each. We can use `getStructurePos()` to get the position of such a generation attempt, and then test whether a structure will actually generate there with `isViableStructurePos()`; however, this is more expensive to compute (requiring many microseconds instead of nanoseconds).

Note: some structures (in particular desert pyramids, jungle temples, and woodland mansions) in 1.18 no longer depend solely on the biomes and can also fail to generate based on the surface height near the generation attempt. Unfortunately, cubiomes does not provide block-level world generation and cannot check for this, and may therefore yield false positive positions. Support for an approximation of the surface height might be added in the future to improve accuracy.


```C
// find a seed with a certain structure at the origin chunk
#include "finders.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int structType = Outpost;
    int mc = MC_1_18;

    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, mc, 0);

    uint64_t lower48;
    for (lower48 = 0; ; lower48++)
    {
        // The structure position depends only on the region coordinates and
        // the lower 48-bits of the world seed.
        Pos p;
        if (!getStructurePos(structType, mc, lower48, 0, 0, &p))
            continue;

        // Look for a seed with the structure at the origin chunk.
        if (p.x >= 16 || p.z >= 16)
            continue;

        // Look for a full 64-bit seed with viable biomes.
        uint64_t upper16;
        for (upper16 = 0; upper16 < 0x10000; upper16++)
        {
            uint64_t seed = lower48 | (upper16 << 48);
            applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);
            if (isViableStructurePos(structType, &g, p.x, p.z, 0))
            {
                printf("Seed %" PRId64 " has a Pillager Outpost at (%d, %d).\n",
                    (int64_t) seed, p.x, p.z);
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Quad-Witch-Huts

A commonly desired feature is Quad-Witch-Huts or similar multi-structure clusters. To test for these types of seeds, we can look a little deeper into how the generation attempts are determined. Notice that the positions depend only on the structure type, region coordinates, and the lower 48 bits of the seed. Also, once we have found a seed with the desired generation attempts, we can move them around by transforming the 48-bit seed using `moveStructure()`. This means there is a set of seed bases that can function as a starting point to generate all other seeds with similar structure placement.

The function `searchAll48()` can be used to find a complete set of 48-bit seed bases for a custom criterion. Given that in general, it can take a very long time to check all 2^48 seeds (days or weeks), the function provides some functionality to save the results to disk which can be loaded again using `loadSavedSeeds()`. Luckily, it is possible in some cases to reduce the search space even further: for Swamp Huts and structures with a similar structure configuration, there are only a handful of constellations where the structures are close enough together to run simultaneously. Conveniently, these constellations differ uniquely at the lower 20 bits. (This is hard to prove, or at least I haven't found a rigorous proof that doesn't rely on brute forcing.) By specifying a list of lower 20-bit values, we can reduce the search space to the order of 2^28, which can be checked in a reasonable amount of time.


```C
// find seeds with a quad-witch-hut about the origin
#include "quadbase.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int check(uint64_t s48, void *data)
{
    const StructureConfig sconf = *(const StructureConfig*) data;
    return isQuadBase(sconf, s48 - sconf.salt, 128);
}

int main()
{
    int styp = Swamp_Hut;
    int mc = MC_1_18;
    uint64_t basecnt = 0;
    uint64_t *bases = NULL;
    int threads = 8;
    Generator g;

    StructureConfig sconf;
    getStructureConfig(styp, mc, &sconf);

    printf("Preparing seed bases...\n");
    // Get all 48-bit quad-witch-hut bases, but consider only the best 20-bit
    // constellations where the structures are the closest together.
    int err = searchAll48(&bases, &basecnt, NULL, threads,
        low20QuadIdeal, 20, check, &sconf);

    if (err || !bases)
    {
        printf("Failed to generate seed bases.\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    setupGenerator(&g, mc, 0);

    uint64_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < basecnt; i++)
    {
        // The quad bases by themselves have structures in regions (0,0)-(1,1)
        // so we can move them by -1 regions to have them around the origin.
        uint64_t s48 = moveStructure(bases[i] - sconf.salt, -1, -1);

        Pos pos[4];
        getStructurePos(styp, mc, s48, -1, -1, &pos[0]);
        getStructurePos(styp, mc, s48, -1,  0, &pos[1]);
        getStructurePos(styp, mc, s48,  0, -1, &pos[2]);
        getStructurePos(styp, mc, s48,  0,  0, &pos[3]);

        uint64_t high;
        for (high = 0; high < 0x10000; high++)
        {
            uint64_t seed = s48 | (high << 48);
            applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

            if (isViableStructurePos(styp, &g, pos[0].x, pos[0].z, 0) &&
                isViableStructurePos(styp, &g, pos[1].x, pos[1].z, 0) &&
                isViableStructurePos(styp, &g, pos[2].x, pos[2].z, 0) &&
                isViableStructurePos(styp, &g, pos[3].x, pos[3].z, 0))
            {
                printf("%" PRId64 "\n", (int64_t) seed);
            }
        }
    }

    free(bases);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Strongholds and Spawn

Strongholds, as well as the world spawn point, actually search until they find a suitable location, rather than checking a single spot like most other structures. This causes them to be particularly slow to find. Furthermore, the positions of strongholds have to be generated in a certain order, which can be done in iteratively with `initFirstStronghold()` and `nextStronghold()`. For the world spawn, the exact coordinate is found after a search for a grass or podzol block prior to 1.18, or for any top-solid nonwaterlogged block in 1.18+. This library cannot model individual blocks, so the search relies on heuristics such as biomes and climate-dependent world heights. Alternatively, we can simply use `estimateSpawn()` and terminate the search after the first biome/climate check under the assumption that grass/a top-solid nonwaterlogged block is nearby.


```C
// find spawn and the first N strongholds
#include "finders.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int mc = MC_1_18;
    uint64_t seed = 3055141959546LL;

    // Only the first stronghold has a position that can be estimated
    // (+/-112 blocks) without biome check.
    StrongholdIter sh;
    Pos pos = initFirstStronghold(&sh, mc, seed);

    printf("Seed: %" PRId64 "\n", (int64_t) seed);
    printf("Estimated position of first stronghold: (%d, %d)\n", pos.x, pos.z);

    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, mc, 0);
    applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

    pos = getSpawn(&g);
    printf("Spawn: (%d, %d)\n", pos.x, pos.z);

    int i, N = 12;
    for (i = 1; i <= N; i++)
    {
        if (nextStronghold(&sh, &g) <= 0)
            break;
        printf("Stronghold #%-3d: (%6d, %6d)\n", i, sh.pos.x, sh.pos.z);
    }

    return 0;
}
```


### Tectonic Terrain

`tectonic.h` adds the terrain of the [Tectonic](https://modrinth.com/mod/tectonic) world generation mod on Minecraft 26.3, for the 3.0.31 mod (default config, `TECTONIC_MOD_3_0_31`) and the 3.0.29 datapack (`TECTONIC_DP_3_0_29`). It is independent of the `Generator`: initialise a `TectonicNoise` from a seed and sample block columns.

```C
// heights and biomes of a Tectonic world
#include "tectonic.h"
#include "util.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    TectonicNoise *tn = malloc(sizeof(TectonicNoise));   // about 100 kB
    initTectonic(tn, TECTONIC_MOD_3_0_31, 93929);

    int x = -21198424, z = -22681504;
    float y = getTectonicHeight(tn, x, z);                // base surface, sea level is 63
    int biome = getTectonicBiomeAt(tn, 1, x, (int) y, z);
    printf("base height at %d, %d is y %.1f (%s)\n", x, z, y, biome2str(MC_26_3, biome));

    // a 256x256 height map, one sample every 16 blocks
    float *map = malloc(sizeof(float) * 256 * 256);
    mapTectonicHeight(map, tn, x - 2048, z - 2048, 256, 256, 16);

    free(map);
    free(tn);
    return 0;
}
```

* `sampleTectonicOffset` / `getTectonicHeight` / `mapTectonicHeight` evaluate Tectonic's complete base surface (`tectonic:terrain_spline/offset/final`: continents, erosion-ridge mountain ranges, plateau regions, islands, ocean floor). The height is `128 * (1 + offset)`, the terrain before Tectonic's peaks and the 3D noise are added; on mountain crests the real surface rises up to ~130 blocks above it.
* `mapApproxHeightTectonic` is the counterpart of `mapApproxHeight` (1:4 scale, optional biome ids).
* `sampleTectonicClimate`, `sampleTectonicBiome` and `getTectonicBiomeAt` give the climate Tectonic feeds to the vanilla biome source, and the resulting biome via `climateToBiome`.
* `sampleTectonicField` gives access to every named density function of the graph (`tectonic:noise/raw_continents`, `tectonic:terrain_spline/offset/regions`, ...).

The density functions in `tectonic_gen.h` are generated from Tectonic's data files (Tectonic is by Apollo and MIT licensed, https://github.com/Apollounknowndev/tectonic) by `tectonic/gen_tectonic.py`. Minecraft 26.3 evaluates noise in single precision, so the module carries its own float noise stack. Compared with the real 26.3 generator the offset, the climate and all 56 named density functions are bit-identical on every one of 200,000 tested positions (10 seed/variant combinations, spawn to the world border); biomes are identical on 99.95% of 128,000 columns, the rest being exact ties between two biomes. `tectonic.c` must not be compiled with floating point contraction (`-ffp-contract=off`, which `CMakeLists.txt` sets). See [tectonic/README.md](tectonic/README.md) for details, the validation scripts, and `tectonic_map`, a small program that renders a height or biome map to a PPM image:

```sh
cmake -B build && cmake --build build
build/tectonic/tectonic_map 93929 -c -21182484 -22681584 -s 64 -n 1024 768 -m 150 -o range.ppm
```
